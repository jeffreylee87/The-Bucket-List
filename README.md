# Bucket-List

Description:

Full-Stack developement app that basically allows you to pen items that you have on your bucket list. I used Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, homemade ORM, and it was deployed on Heroku with the assistance of JawsDB.  This was the first assignment that we utilized all these tools together and I followed the MVC design pattern. 


Usage: 

Click on the pen to add items to the "Goals - Red Post It". It's pretty much the items you would eventually want to do, then hit the check mark if you completed the item, which will transfer to the "Completed - Blue Post It". Hit the "poo" emoji if you would like to delete that item.
